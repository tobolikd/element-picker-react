# EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project
# across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles
# and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.
# EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
